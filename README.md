# cleaning
The purpose of the application is a program that automatically deletes accumulated dead or unnecessary files from the programs we use. It automatically deletes temp and %temp% files that we constantly delete. In this way, we do not have to bother with entering 2 different files, even if it is small.

NOTE : The application will not delete some files. For those who don't know, the reason for this is that the program of the file to be deleted is currently being used. If you close the application that contains the file or the tool that Windows uses, it will delete the file.
